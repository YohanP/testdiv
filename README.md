# TIAD Demo

## Disclaimer
This is a very first draft of the automation deployment tool I demonstrated at TIAD. I plan to redesign it much more cleanly in the future (help welcome!)

The Jenkins workflow to redeploy is not here yet but I will add it soon

## Using it
### 1. Fork it and configure it for you

Change the HostedZoneName (environment/(integration|prod)/common.properties)  
Create an AMI with a web site (for example)
 
### 2. Load config data in the dynamoDB referential

By default the Dynamo Table is called Stacks and will be created if it does not exist  
These commands will configure 3 cloudformation stacks and the associated dependencies:
- Infrastructure (associated cloudformation template: environment/common.template.json)
- Backends (environment/shared-demo.template.json)
- Application (environment/app-demo.template.json)

```
./setparams.py -T Stacks -t common -n infra-int ../environment/integration/common.properties
./setparams.py -T Stacks -t shared -n shared-demo-int -k depends=infra-int  ../environment/integration/shared-demo-nodb.properties
./setparams.py -T Stacks -t application -n demo-int -k depends=shared-demo-int  ../environment/integration/demo.properties
```

### 3. Build stacks

The build tool is retrieving the templates from an S3 bucket so they can be centralized.  
The default bucket is demo-templates which is publicly readable but you can easily change it and upload custom cloudformation templates

```
./build.py -n infra-int -t integration build
./build.py -n shared-demo-int -t integration build
./build.py -n demo-int -t integration build AppAMI=ami-xxxxx
```
